# Dispatch a Driver

You can now dispatch drivers in your fleet through both the web and mobile apps.

## Dispatching from the Website

Visit [https://www.meterapp.co/en/fleet/manage_fleet](https://www.meterapp.co/en/fleet/manage_fleet) to manage your fleet and dispatch drivers. Simply click on the dispatch row for a driver, and you'll be able to send them a dispatch to an origin and destination in real-time. The driver will receive a notification and can navigate to the pickup location.

## Dispatching from the App

If you prefer using the app, navigate to the **Fleet** tab on your Android or iOS device. Select a driver, and youâ€™ll have the option to dispatch them directly from there. The driver will be notified and can use their preferred navigation method.

### Navigation Options

Drivers can choose their favorite navigation option: Google Maps, Waze, or Meter (powered by Google Maps). For the best experience, we recommend using Meter for navigation.

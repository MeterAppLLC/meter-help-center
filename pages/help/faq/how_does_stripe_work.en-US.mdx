# How does stripe work?

In Meter, we want to help drivers earn as much money as possible, which is why we've set up our payment system with QR codes. The passenger will pay all fees by credit card, and you'll keep the full fare. Additionally, passengers are more likely to tip through the QR code payment system because it provides an easy way to tip. Finally, Stripe will pay you every 3 days, sometimes it takes a few days longer, but once set up, you'll receive payment after 3 days.

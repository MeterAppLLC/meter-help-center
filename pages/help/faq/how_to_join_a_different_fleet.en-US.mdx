# How to Join a Different Fleet

## Step 1: Leave or Delete Your Current Fleet

1. **Visit the Fleet Management Page**:

2. **Leave or Delete Your Current Fleet**:
- Scroll to the bottom of the page.
- Click on either the **Delete Fleet** or **Leave Fleet** button, depending on whether you own the fleet or are a member.

3. **Confirm the Action**:
- A confirmation prompt will appear.
- Confirm the action to either delete or leave the fleet.

> **Note:** Deleting a fleet is irreversible and will permanently remove it from your account.

## Step 2: Join a New Fleet

1. **Visit the Fleet Join Page**:
- Navigate to [Join Fleet](https://www.meterapp.co/en/fleet/join).

2. **Enter the Fleet Join Code**:
- Enter the 6-character fleet join code provided by the new fleet.

3. **Join the Fleet**:
- Click on **Join Fleet** to complete the process.

> **Tip:** Ensure you have the correct join code from the new fleet you intend to join.
